Backchannel App

Running the application:
To start the application, start the server and go to localhost:3000 in your browser. From there, all functionality should allow you to transition back and forth, performing all of the proper actions. 

Testing:
RSpec was used for testing. All files created for spec tests (views, models, controllers, routes, requests, and helpers) are located under the path csc517_backChannel/spec. The files in csc517_backChannel/test only contain basic testing.
